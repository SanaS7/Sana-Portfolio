# Porfolio

## Description
In this challenge, I have made my profile. 
I have used different CSS styles in my challenge like flex box, media query, typography and CSS variables.
The motivation was to show the skills in my profile by using different CSS styles.
     
Before I didn't had any profile and my work wasn't visible to other people, by making a profile page now I have all my work on my page and anyone can see that.
I have learned about different CSS styles which include flex-box, media- query, typography.
